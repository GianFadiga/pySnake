# Snake Game in Python
This is a simple snake game made with Pygame for educational purposes. It was created by Gianlucca Fadiga based on a tutorial by Programador Sagaz (YouTube tutorial link).

The purpose of this project is to help Gianlucca Fadiga learn Git and GitHub, and to practice using branches and commits.

## Game Description
The game features a snake that moves around the screen, trying to eat as many apples as possible. The snake grows in size with each apple it eats. The game code includes functions for generating random positions for the apple, detecting collisions between the snake and the apple, and updating the snake's position and direction.
The game ends after the maxsize or by closing it on keyboard key press `Q`, otherwise, the game will never end by the snake eating eatself.

## Game Controls
The snake's direction can be controlled with the arrow keys on the keyboard:

Up arrow key: move the snake up
Right arrow key: move the snake right
Down arrow key: move the snake down
Left arrow key: move the snake left
